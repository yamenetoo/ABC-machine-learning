# Dataset folder 
This folder contains several Datasets that we use throughout the course
# Python code
* Pandas: introduction to Pandas package
* classification problems 1:
  -  In this section, we provide a practical application for several classification models for different types of data.

  -  The goal is to familiarize ourselves with various machine learning models available in the scikit-learn library and understand how to invoke and configure these models.

  -  Additionally, we aim to explore new types of data, specifically images, and how to handle them using these models.
* Sklearn Metrics
  
  In this section, we explore quantitative metrics used to evaluate model performance in tasks such as classification, regression, or clustering. Regression metrics, such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE), assess the prediction of continuous variables, while classification metrics like Confusion Matrix, Accuracy Score, and F1 Score evaluate categorization performance. These metrics play a crucial role in quantifying, comparing, and optimizing models, assisting in making informed decisions for deployment based on specific task goals and characteristics.

* Sklearn Preprocessing 
  
  In this section, we illustrate preprocessing tasks, transforming raw data before inputting it into a model. Tasks include cleaning data by addressing missing values, duplicates, and errors, transforming numerical and categorical features, reducing dimensionality, splitting data for training and testing, addressing imbalanced data, scaling features, and normalizing distributions. The quality of preprocessing significantly influences model performance and generalization, with specific steps depending on the data's nature and algorithm requirements.
